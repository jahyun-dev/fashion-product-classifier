# Fashion Product Image Classifier
## Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Capstone Project

 This repository is a Capstone Project repository by Udacity Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree. The theme of the Capstone Project is to create a deep learning model that predicts fashion product images.

#### Environment

- OS : Linux
- Python 3.6.9

#### Python Packages

- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- pytorch
- liveloss
- sklearn

### Dataset

[Fashion Product Images (Small)](https://www.kaggle.com/paramaggarwal/fashion-product-images-small)

44000 products with category labels and images.

### Development Setup

To run [fashion-product-classifier.ipynb] (./ fashion-product-classifier.ipynb) you must get the dataset in the location `data / fashion-product-images-small.zip`.
